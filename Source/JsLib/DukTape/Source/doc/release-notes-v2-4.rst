=========================
Duktape 2.4 release notes
=========================

Release overview
================

TBD.

* Symbol built-in is now enabled by default.
* Add duk_to_stacktrace() and duk_safe_to_stacktrace() to make it easier to get stacktraces in C

Upgrading from Duktape 2.3
==========================

No action (other than recompiling) should be needed for most users to upgrade
from Duktape v2.3.x.  Note the following:

* Symbol built-in (Symbol(xxx), Symbol.toPrimitive, etc) is now enabled
  by default.  If you don't want the built-in, disable
  ``DUK_USE_SYMBOL_BUILTIN`` in tools/configure.py.
